Life tables are essential tools used by entomologists to study the population dynamics and life history traits
of insect species. These tables explore a species by describing its biology from a quantitative and qual-
itative point of view. They provide valuable insights into the development, reproduction, and mortality
rates of insect populations. They provide a method for understanding the population dynamics of insect
species, which is crucial for various fields including pest management, conservation biology, and ecological
research.
In the first chapter of the report, an important problem with the representation of these life tables will be
considered: The lack of a standard in data collection and a great confusion among the different representa-
tions. Also, a loss of information is often present because of not supplementing the raw dataset. A
generalisation of data processing will be proposed, using an easy to manage excel file (GitHub: Standard datasheet Life tables).
In the second chapter, the general representations from this excel file will be used to compose useful data
for users. Using the impulse responses of each stage, an attempt will be made to compose the whole life
cycle. Using regular data processing, it will be shown that the original plots of the insects life stages can be
composed. For this, a MATLAB script is composed (GitHub: download all files and run RunMe_Main).
The third and final chapter of this report will explain what should be done if an insects life cycle could not
be noted down individually during tests, but only in cohort grouping. This is representing another loss
of information for which extra measurements should be made (instead of repeating the whole experiment
individually). These involve solving an optimisation problem to estimate the individual insect lifes, starting
from a cohort grouping dataset.
